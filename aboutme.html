  <div class="description">
<p> I am a sophomore at Crossroads High School. In my free time I enjoy reading. playing tennis, and baking. I enjoy learning new things in school, and my favorite subjects are history, english, and newspaper. I chose to attend Girls Who Code this Summer because I spend a lot of time on the internet, and I would like to learn more about how it works. </p>
