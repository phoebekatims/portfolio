<p> I am a rising junior at Crossroads High School . In my free time I enjoy reading. playing tennis, and drinking coffee. I love school, and my favorite subjects are history and English. I joined Girls Who Code this Summer because I spend a lot of time online, and I want to know the science behind it.
  </p>
    <p> Today we used Python for the first time. It was fun using a more advanced programming language, and it was very different from Scratch because it was harder to use and more advanced. Python was also less likely to glitch, and when we coded a program that made shapes it did not break if the input value was under 500. In scratch, the code broke at 16 when I made a similar program.
